# CONTRIBUTING helper

This is a small helper script to analyze all the "sources" (i.e., original repositories) in a github org and file bugs / pull requests for those repositories do *NOT* have a CONTRIBUTING file.

This ensures that all repositories in an org make explicit what the requirements for contributing code to the organization are, be it a simple "this is how you submit a successful pull request" or "you have to sign this agreement before you can contribute".
